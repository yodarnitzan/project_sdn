Histogram demo
==============

A demo for the density estimation/histogram classes.

Demonstrates:
 - collecting observations into statistics objects
 - saving statistics objects to file and restoring them

About the model

The network consists of a single module. It goes into a loop to generate
random numbers. The numbers are inserted into histograms and other
density estimation objects using different algorithms. Some of the objects
use the first n numbers to estimate a range, and set up histogram cells
accordingly.

When you start the model, it will ask a couple of questions; it is OK
to accept the defaults offered. When you run the model, several inspector
windows will appear which display histogram-like diagrams. (The corresponding
objects you can find in the object tree on the left side of the main
window, after opening the "Histograms" and "local-objects" nodes.)

The following classes are demonstrated:

* cDoubleHistogram
A histogram with equidistant cells. Cell boundaries are real numbers
(doubles). In the default scenario of this demo, the lower histogram bound
is zero, and the upper bound is estimated from the first n (by default 50)
observations.

* cLongHistogram
A histogram with equidistant cells. Cell boundaries are integers. Histogram
bounds are set up similarly to cDoubleHistogram.

* cVarHistogram
A histogram with arbitrary cells. Cell boundaries can be set up manually
(via the addBinBound() member function of the C++ class), but it is also
possible to have them set them up automatically based on the first n
observations such that each cell contains approximately the same number
of observations. (Cell boundaries don't change afterwards.) The latter method
is used in this demo.

* cPSquare
Implementation of the P^2 (P-square) algorithm from Jain and Chlamtac.
It is an on-line density estimation method that works by estimating and
keeping track of quantiles. The resulting (calculated) histogram will
thus contain roughly equi-probable cells.

* cKSplit
An adaptive histogram structure which splits those cells that receive
"too many" observations (this is defined by a split criterion), thus
"refining the resolution" at (or "zooming in" on) the interesting parts
of the distribution.
